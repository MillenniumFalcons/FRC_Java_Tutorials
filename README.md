## Setting up java on your laptop ##
In order to program in Java on your laptop, we need to install the necessary files and software before we actually start programming. In order to run and edit java files, we need a java compiler. We are going to install Eclipse. Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming and is the most widely used Java IDE. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.

For setting up java on eclipse:
* If you have Windows, please click [here](https://youtu.be/wf6Qp-ecsog)
* If you have a Mac:
  * 1st Click [here](https://youtu.be/y6szNJ4rMZ0) for instructions on how to install the Java JDK
