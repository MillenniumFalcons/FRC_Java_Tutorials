/*
Lesson _05
In this exercise, you will use void functions to calculate magnitude and the direction of a vector from their x-component, and y-component

Feel free to look up the formulas for both finding the direction and the magnitude of a vector
Remember that you don't need parameters for this exercise, because the variables are static

Good Luck Completing the exercise!
